ScalaEdit
=========
OBS ScalaEdit is in an early development phase at the moment so unfortunately no usable version is available.

The runnable binaries will be available at:
http://googlecode.scala-edit.com

ScalaEdit is a text editor. It is especially designed for Scala programmers but is usable by anyone. It has a Scala interpreter Console with syntax highlighting built-in so it could be useful only for that reason.
